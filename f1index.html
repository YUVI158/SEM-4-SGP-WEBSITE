                <h4 class="topics2a">Aerodynamics</h4>
                <p class="define">The study about how the air flows around the f1 and how it affects the car its components
                  and it performance. </p>
      
                <h4 class="topics2a">CAD</h4>
                <p class="define">A switch in the cockpit to alter the split of the car's braking power between the front and
                  the rear wheels
                  <br>according to a driver's wishes.
                </p>
      
                <h4 class="topics2a">CFD</h4>
                <p class="define">Short for Computational fluid dynamics, a tool used by F1 designers that uses complex
                  mathematics and simulation
                  <br> to predict aerodynamic airflow. Normally used in conjunction with traditional wind tunnel research.
                </p>
      
                <h4 class="topics2a">Clean air</h4>
                <p class="define">Air that isn't turbulent, and thus offers optimum aerodynamic conditions, as experienced by
                  a car at the head of the field.</p>
      
                <h4 class="topics2a">Coanda effect</h4>
                <p class="define">The tendency of a fluid jet, such as airflow, to be attracted to a nearby surface. F1
                  aerodynamicists use the effect to
                  <br>help divert airflow to specific areas of the car, for example from the exhaust exit to the rear
                  diffuser.
                </p>
                <h4 class="topics2a">Downforce</h4>
                <p class="define">The aerodynamic force that is applied in a downwards direction as a car travels forwards.
                  This is harnessed to improve a
                  <br>car's traction and its handling through corners.
                </p>
      
                <h4 class="topics2a">Drag</h4>
                <p class="define">The aerodynamic resistance experienced as a car travels forwards.</p>
      
                <h4 class="topics2a">DRS</h4>
                <p class="define">Also known as adjustable rear wings, DRS (Drag Reduction System) rear wings allow the driver
                  to adjust the wing between two
                  <br> pre-determined settings from the cockpit. The system's availability is electronically governed - it can
                  be used at any time in practice
                  <br> and qualifying (unless a driver is on wet-weather tyres), but during the race can only be activated
                  when a driver is less than one
                  <br>second behind another car at pre-determined points on the track. The system is then deactivated once the
                  driver brakes. In combination
                  <br>with KERS, it is designed to boost overtaking. Also like KERS, it isn't compulsory.
                </p>
      
                <h4 class="topics2a">Slipstreaming</h4>
                <p class="define">A driving tactic when a driver is able to catch the car ahead and duck in behind its rear
                  wing to benefit from a reduction
                  <br> in drag over its body and hopefully be able to achieve a superior maximum speed to slingshot past
                  before the next corner.
                </p>
      
                <h4 class="topics2a">Turbulence</h4>
                <p class="define">The result of the disruption of airflow caused by an interruption to its passage, such as
                  when it hits a rear wing and its
                  <br> horizontal flow is spoiled.

                  soften and break
                  <br>away in chunks from the body of the tyre. Blistering can be caused by the selection of an inappropriate
                  tyre compound
                  <br>(for example, one that is too soft for circuit conditions), too high tyre pressure, or an improperly set

                <p class="define">The rear section of the car's floor or undertray where the air flowing under the car exits.
                  The design of the
                  <br>diffuser is crucial as it controls the speed at which the air exits. The faster its exit, the lower the
                  air pressure beneath

                <h4 class="topics2a">Torque</h4>
                <p class="define">Literally, the turning or twisting force of an engine, torque is generally used as a measure
                  of an engine's
                  <br> flexibility. An engine may be very powerful, but if it has little torque then that power may only be
                  available over a
                  <br> limited rev range, making it of limited use to the driver. An engine with more torque - even if it has
                  less power - may
                  <br> actually prove quicker on many tracks, as the power is available over a far wider rev range and hence
                  more accessible.
                  <br> Good torque is particularly vital on circuits with a number of mid- to slow-speed turns, where
                  acceleration out of the
                  <br> corners is essential to a good lap time.

                  traction - ie spinning
                  <br> and transfers more drive to the wheel with more traction, thus using its more power efficiently.
                  Outlawed from the

                <h4 class="topics2a">Turbocharger</h4>
                <p class="define">Attached to the engine, a turbocharger uses an exhaust driven turbine to drive a compressor
                  to increase the
                  <br> density of the intake air consumed by the engine. Denser air helps an engine create more power for its
                  size. The residual
                  <br> heat energy contained in the exhaust gases after expansion in the cylinders of the engine is converted
                  to mechanical
                  <br> shaft power by the exhaust turbine. The mechanical power from the turbine is used to drive not only the
                  compressor, but
                  <br> also the MGU-H (see ERS).

                <h4 class="topics2a">Blistering</h4>
                <p class="define">The consequence of a tyre, or part of a tyre, overheating. Excess heat can cause rubber to soften and break 
                  <br>away in chunks from the body of the tyre. Blistering can be caused by the selection of an inappropriate tyre compound 
                  <br>(for example, one that is too soft for circuit conditions), too high tyre pressure, or an improperly set up car.</p>
                <h4 class="topics2a">Degradation</h4>
                <p class="define">A term used to describe the process by which a tyre loses performance or grip. Different from tyre wear which 
                  <br>concerns the process by which the tread is worn away.</p>
                
                  <h4 class="topics2a">Compound</h4>
                <p class="define">Tread compound is the part of any tyre in contact with the road and therefore one of the major factors in deciding
                  <br> tyre performance. The ideal compound is one with maximum grip but which still maintains durability and heat resistance. 
                  <br>A typical Formula One race compound will have more than ten ingredients such as rubbers, polymers, sulphur, carbon black, oil and 
                  <br>other curatives. Each of these includes a vast number of derivatives any of which can be used to a greater or lesser degree. Very 
                  <br>small changes to the mix can change compound performance.</p>
                
                  <h4 class="topics2a">Flat spot</h4>
                <p class="define">The term given to the area of a tyre that is worn heavily on one spot after a moment of extreme braking or in the
                  <br> course of a spin. This ruins its handling, often causing severe vibration, and may force a driver to pit for a replacement
                  <br> set of tyres. </p>
                <h4 class="topics2a">Graining</h4>
                <p class="define">When a car slides, it can cause little bits or rubber ('grains') to break away from the tyre's grooves. These then
                  <br> stick to the tread of the tyre, effectively separating the tyre from the track surface very slightly. For the driver, the
                  <br> effect is like driving on ball bearings. Careful driving can clear the graining within a few laps, but will obviously have an
                  <br> effect on the driver's pace. Driving style, track conditions, car set-up, fuel load and the tyre itself all play a role in
                  <br> graining. In essence, the more the tyre moves about on the track surface (ie slides), the more likely graining is. </p>
                
                <h4 class="topics2a">Grip</h4>
                <p class="define">The amount of traction a car has at any given point, affecting how easy it is for the driver to keep control 
                  <br>through corners. </p>
                
                <h4 class="topics2a">Heat cycle</h4>
                <p class="define">A term used to describe the process by which a tyre is heated through use and then cooled down. This has the effect of
                  <br> slightly changing the properties of the compound and can improve durability. </p>
                
                <h4 class="topics2a">Lock-up</h4>
                <p class="define"> The term used to describe a driver braking sharply and 'locking' one or more tyres whilst the others continue rotating.
                  <br> Tyre smoke and flat spots are common side effects.</p>
                
                <h4 class="topics2a">Tyre compound</h4>
                <p class="define">The type of rubber mix used in the construction of a tyre, ranging from soft through medium to hard, with each offering
                  <br> a different performance and wear characteristic. </p>
      
                <h4 class="topics2a">Tyre warmer</h4>
